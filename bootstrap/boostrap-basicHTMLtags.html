  than the screen or browser window; and pages are often longer than
  the browser window. This tag sets the width of the page equal to the
  width of the browser window. The height stays the same. -->

  <h1>Common HTML Elements in Bootstrap</h1>

  <h2>Some HTML tags</h2>

  <p>This is a list of some common HTML tags on a page styled with Bootstrap 4. There is no other CSS on this page, other than that provided by Boostrap.</p>

  <div class="textemphasis">
    <h3>Text Emphasis</h3>
    <p><B>Italic and Bold</B> &lti&gt and &ltb&gt are used to display text in an italic font, such as for names of movies like <i>Back to the Future III</i>.
      You might also want to use bold text that is <b>important</b>.
    </p>
    <P><b>Emphasised and Strong Text</B> &ltem&gt and &ltstring&gt There are also tags for <em>emphasized text</em> and for <strong>strong text</strong> which have
      slightly different meanings to italic &lti&gt and bold &ltb&gt tags, but display the same in most browsers.
    </P>
    <P><b>Escape characters</b> To display special HTML characters on a page, such as &gt and &lt and &amp, you need to use escape sequences.
      So to display &amp you need to type "&ampamp" in your HTML, for &gt and &lt you need to type "&ampgt" and "&amplt"
    </P>
  </div>

  <div class="formatting_blocks">
    <h3>Formatting Blocks of Text</h3>
    <pre><b>Preformatted text</b> The &ltpre&gt tag is for pre-formatted text. It displays in a monospace font, and unlike p tags, lines of text that are wider than the browser window do not wrap,
  spaces        and returns
    and tabs          in the HTML source are preserved and displayed in the browser. This may be useful for code.
  </pre>
    <p>
      <code>
        <b>Code blocks</b> There's also a &ltcode&gt tag. Unlike pre, this mostly changes the font, does not preserve tabs, and wraps. You may need to do some extra work in CSS to display code nicely.
    <P>
      console.log("hello world!");
    </P>
    </code>
    </p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote"><b>Block quotes</b> &ltblockquote&gt is another way to display text in a block; by default this text is indented, but in Bootstrap the text  and it's purpose is to display quotes. </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="organizing">
    <h3>Organizing Sections</h3>
    <P><b>Span</b> &ltspan&gt tags are mostly used for applying styles to text within a paragraph.
      There's a <span>span in this paragraph</span> but you'll only see it if you look at the source,
      or apply a visible style to span tags.
    </P>
    <p><b>Div</b> &ltdiv&gt tags are for organizing content into sections.
      It's common to add a class attribute to label your sections.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="organizing_info">
    <h3>Organizing Information</h3>
    <p><b>Tables</b> use many tags. &lttable&gt, &lttr&gt, &ltth&gt, &lttd&gt...
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">There are some example tables at W3Schools</a>.
    </p>
    <P>It's very common to use extra CSS to apply styles to tables, for example, borders, or background colors to cells, since the default version is very basic.</P>
    <P>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Class Code</th>
        <th>Class Name</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1100</td>
        <td>Info Tech Concepts</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1110</td>
        <td>Info Tech Skills</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </P>
    <p><b>Definition</b> lists are used to relate terms and definitions.
      &ltdl&gt tags create a definition list, &ltdt&gt define terms and &ltdd&gt for that
      term's definition.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>HTML</dt>
      <dd>What does the text/resource represent?</dd>
      <dt>CSS</dt>
      <dd>What should it look like?</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Like tables, the basic definition list is <i>very</i> basic, and is usually made to look nicer with more of your CSS.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="images">
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p><b>Images</b> are important to brand and personalize a website. To add an image, use the &gtimg&lt tag, and remember to specify the image's location.
      This can either be the path to the image, relative to where you page is saved OR a URL.
    <P>Download and save various sample images from a public domain site like <a href="http://www.pixabay.com">pixabay</a>.
    </p>
    <p>An image saved in the same directory as your web page can be displayed like so:</p>
    <P>&ltimg src="kittens.jpg"&gt</P>
    <P><img src="images/kittens.jpg"></P>
    <p>And an image resource from another website can be displayed like this:</p>
    <P>&ltimg src="https://placebear.com/200/400"&gt</P>
    <P><img src="https://placebear.com/200/400"></P>
  </div>

  <div class="links">
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <P><b>Hyperlinks, or links for short</b> The &lta&gt tag is used to create links. You'll need the URL of the resource OR the path to another page.
      The local link will only work if you downloaded all of the pages from this week's examples. Here are some examples:
    <P>
      <a href="http://www.minneapolis.edu">MCTC's website, a remote resource</a>
    </P>
    <P>
      <a href="hello-bootstrap.html">Another Bootstrap example; a local file</a>
    </P>
    <P>You can add &lta&gt tags around images to make them clickable. Click on the cat image below to go to a larger version at pixabay.
    </P>
    <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/cat-animal-cute-pet-feline-kitty-618470/"><img src="images/small-cat.jpg"></a>
    </P>
  </div>

  <div class="lists">
    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <P><b>Ordered and unordered lists</b> There are two types of lists, ordered, with numbers; and unordered, with bullet points.</P>
    <P>Use the &ltol&gt tag to create an ordered list, then the &ltli&gt tag to define individual numbered list elements</P>
    <ol>
      <li>First of all...</li>
      <li>And then you should....</li>
      <li>And finally...</li>
    </ol>
    <P>Use the &ltul&gt tag to create a list, then the &ltli&gt tag to define individual
      bullet-point list elements.
    </P>
    <ul>
      <li>Pictures</li>
      <li>Links</li>
      <li>Lists</li>
    </ul>
